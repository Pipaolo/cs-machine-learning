    "Lifestyle diabetes is diabetes that you can get for having horrible day to day lifestyle choices. It is primarily type 2 diabetes since it is the one that is dependent on your body, especially your age. You can prevent this by having a proper diet, exercise and a decent weight loss regime if advised by the doctor.\n",

In doing so we can spread awareness as to how we can prevent diabetes from happening in the first place. Even the treatment method should improve after we unlock all the secrets that encapsulates the disease diabetes. We can also predict if such lifestyle choices are going to lead into a situation in which a person will have diabetes in the future.\n"
